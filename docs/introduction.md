What is this?
-------------

This is an annual quick-start guide to developing the full-stack behind an application. Everything from the front-end, to the back-end, to the devops is covered here. It's an opinionated guide that uses a strict set of technology to put together a modern stack for a generic web app. We won't go over mobile, but it can be easily used for a mobile back-end as well.

Who is it for?
--------------

Beginner and experienced developers alike. Consider this a tutorial to take a quick look at different technologies to know when to use what.

You may be mostly a front-end or back-end developer but it's important to understand what everyone on a team has to deal with and why decisions are made.

How do I use it?
----------------

Go through each section in order and follow the instructions to set this app up yourself. Going through the process of getting your local machine configured is crucial to understand how these pieces fit together. Think of it like a study guide.

You should walk away armed with knowledge of how to set these tools up as well as arguments for why they should be used in the first place. Of course, this is considering a generic system, specific use-cases will benefit from different tools.

This will go out of date
------------------------

Technology is rapidly improving right under our feet. This can be frustrating, but it's part of our jobs to always stay on top of the latest technology. Next year, there will be a 2019 version of this guide that will use whatever the current technology is at that point.

**No** attempt at backwards compatibility from the 2019 stack to the 2018 stack will be made. The goal is to provide whatever the current best option for a generic greenfield app.

Please don't be offended
------------------------

It's human nature to get attached to our own communities. It's completely normal to feel slighted if I think that the tools I've picked are not the ones you would have selected.
